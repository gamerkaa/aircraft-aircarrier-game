# Aircraft AirCarrier Game
This repository is for saving game elements and documentation for the Aircraft AirCarrier Game

## Origin of the game
I made the game with an interest in aircraft and flying vehicles. So I thought why not make a game
that is relatable and gives a sense of satisfaction after having achieved an objective.
Thats how I started delving into my interest and got this idea of driving a huge plane that is a
learning experience in itself. The game is slow-paced and easy to play provided you as a user give
ample time to learn it. It is a very different experience from usual air plane games as the plane
itself is unusually different. The game visuals and mechanics augment the slow calm movement and it
is also satisfying to watch the various scenery pass by slowly (fast by at a bit high altitude looks
slow). On getting to play mission, the pace picks up but then the attention is on achievement of
objective who worries about the passing aircarrier yard when experience points are to be earned.
